### TestMod
A mod for testing random things  
This mod won't be continously updated  
Currently it increases your sprint speed and provides chat commands like  
/spawn scrap <name> (amount=\<amount\>) (position={random, @me, @\<playername\>})  
or  
/spawn special gun (amount=\<amount\>) (position={random, @me, @\<playername\>})

### GoOutWithABangMod
Spawns a mine on player and triggers it when they die, unless they die to explosion or unknown  

### KarmaForBeingAnnoyingMod
Blows up the player who uses any of the annoying scrap that makes sound (clown horn, blow horn, ...)  
This only kills the player using the item, as they deserve it  
It has a 10% chance of activating
