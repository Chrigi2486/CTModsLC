### KarmaForBeingAnnoyingMod
Blows up the player who uses any of the annoying scrap that makes sound (clown horn, blow horn, ...)
This only kills the player using the item, as they deserve it.  
By default it has a 10% chance of activating.
This version spawns an explosion only client sided so everyone else is confused what the player died from.
